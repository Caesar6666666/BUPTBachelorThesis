本研究旨在探索可控扩散模型在文本生成中的应用，特别是在生成符合语法和语义要求的bash命令方面。通过系统学习和深入研究扩散模型的发展现状和技术趋势，本研究明确了三个主要目标：选择合适的扩散模型作为项目基础、实现从自然语言到bash命令的生成、以及改进模型的准确度和多样性。通过文献调研和资料收集，本研究综合了多篇关键论文的技术方法，并对bash命令的处理和模型准确度与多样性的提升进行了深入探讨。

本研究采用了DiffuSeq模型，并结合Classifier-Free Guidance技术，提出了改进的Classifier-Free模型。通过对比实验，该模型在BLEU、ROUGE-L、Nl2CMD-Metric、BertScore、Dist-1和Acc等多个性能指标上均优于DiffuSeq和原始Classifier-Free模型。特别是在准确性和多样性方面，改进后的模型展现出显著的提升。研究结果表明，通过对扩散模型的改进和训练方法的创新，可以有效提高bash命令生成的性能，为可控文本生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

This research aims to explore the application of controllable diffusion models in text generation, particularly in the generation of bash commands that meet syntactic and semantic requirements. By systematically studying and investigating the current state and technological trends of diffusion models, this study identified three main objectives: to select an appropriate diffusion model as the project basis, to realize the generation from natural language to bash commands, and to improve the model's accuracy and diversity. Through literature review and data collection, this study synthesized the technical methods of several key papers and delved into the processing of bash commands and the enhancement of model accuracy and diversity.

The study adopted the DiffuSeq model and combined it with Classifier-Free Guidance technology to propose an improved Classifier-Free model. Comparative experiments showed that this model outperforms the DiffuSeq and original Classifier-Free models across multiple performance metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE-L, Nl2CMD-Metric, BertScore, Dist-1, and Acc. Notably, the improved model demonstrated significant enhancements in accuracy and diversity. The findings suggest that through the refinement of diffusion models and innovation in training methods, the performance of bash command generation can be effectively improved, providing a new solution for the field of controllable text generation.
